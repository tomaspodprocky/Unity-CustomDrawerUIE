This project will be merged with the Unity-Playground repository as it fits there better than a standalone repository

# Unity-CustomDrawerUIE
Small unity project to test how to create a custom drawer - a drop down menu - using UIElements. 

I did it by following the [Unity tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-HowTo-CreateCustomInspector.html) and of course experimenting a bit.
The goal was to have a custom drawer for Scriptable Objects. These could be created at any point within a Unity project. Instead of referencing a Scriptable Object by drag-dropping it into the inspector field, I wanted to have a drop down menu with all available objects of a certain type and simply select them there.
